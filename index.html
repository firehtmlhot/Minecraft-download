	We present to your attention the announcement of the upcoming update for Minecraft Bedrock 1.17.0 for Android! Most recently, developer Mojang held a very significant event called Minecraft Live 2020, which presented new innovations that will be added to the Minecraft world in the Minecraft PE 1.17 update.
